# car-accidents-client
Front end (client-side) of the car accident analyzation website. 

This website allows users to find car accidents from the Kaggle Database (https://www.kaggle.com/code/michaelbergerson/us-car-accidents-traffic-data-analysis/data) with
the ability to customize their query. Users are able to filter date and time, temperature, and sample size. Results returned from the server will be presented using
a Plotly graph and chart.
